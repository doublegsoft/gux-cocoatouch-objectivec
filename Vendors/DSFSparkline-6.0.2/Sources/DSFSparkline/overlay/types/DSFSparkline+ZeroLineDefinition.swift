		///   - color: The color to draw the zero line
		///   - lineWidth: The width of the zero line
		///   - lineDashStyle: The pattern for drawing the line. An array of values that specify the lengths, in user space coordinates, of the painted and unpainted segments of the dash pattern. For example, the array [2,3] sets a dash pattern that alternates between a 2-unit-long painted segment and a 3-unit-long unpainted segment. The array [1,3,4,2] sets the pattern to a 1-unit painted segment, a 3-unit unpainted segment, a 4-unit painted segment, and a 2-unit unpainted segment. Pass an empty array to clear the dash pattern so that all stroke drawing in the context uses solid lines.
